# resin-pi-trafficlights

This is the repo for an upcoming blog post that will use [resin.io](https://resin.io) with a fleet of four Raspberry Pi, each equipped with a set of Low Voltage Labs [traffic light LEDs](http://lowvoltagelabs.com/products/pi-traffic/).

This `README.md` will get updated when the blog post is completed.
